# Applications

I believe in publicly sharing application outcomes (for undergrad admissions, graduate admissions, job applications, fellowship applications, etc.), as well as application materials (when permitted). We hear too much about our peers' successes and not enough about their failures, which can lead to feelings of inferiority/being an imposter when we inevitably experience numerous failures of our own.

I will update this list with more applications as I dig them up...

## 2018

I (naively) applied to Ph.D. programs in robotics/ML without any real research experience in the field (had some ML experience, but not related to robotics). This was a big reality-check for me, and led me to leaving my job at Google to work in a robotics research lab at Samsung Research.
