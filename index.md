My name is Ben Eisner, and I'm a Machine Learning and Robotics researcher. I build robotic systems that learn to interact with the unstructured world.

I'm currently a 1st-Year Ph.D. student in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm a member of the [Robots Perceiving and Doing Lab](https://r-pad.github.io/), led by [Prof. David Held](https://davheld.github.io/). Right now, I'm working on some techniques for policy transfer. My research is supported in part by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

Here is a recent version of my [academic cv]({{site.cv_path}}), my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RWe-v0UAAAAJ&hl=en) profile, and my [Github](https://github.com/beneisner) profile.
