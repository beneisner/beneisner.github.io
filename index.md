# About Me!
My name is Ben Eisner, and I'm a Machine Learning Researcher and Software Engineer focusing on robotic systems that learn to interact with the unstructured world. I have a strong background in machine learning research and engineering, and have helped build systems that are used by hundreds of millions of people around the world.

Here a recent version of my [resume]({{site.resume_path}}).
