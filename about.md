### Hi!
My name is Ben Eisner, and I'm a software developer and Junior studying Computer Science at Princeton University. I'm interested in Applied Artifical Intelligence Research, Robotics, and Space Flight. On campus, I am the Director of the Careers Team in the [Princeton Entrepreneurship Club](http://www.princetoneclub.com), play [Ultimate Frisbee](http://www.princeton.edu/~clockwrk/), and perform with the Lobster Club Improv Comedy group.

I have experience in frontend and backend development - here's my [resume](../{{site.resume_path}}), and here are my Github profile: {% include icon-github.html username="beneisner" %} and my [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/{{site.linkedin_username}}).

You can reach me at [{{site.email}}](mailto:{{site.email}}).
