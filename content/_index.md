Hello! I'm a 5th-Year Ph.D. student in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, working with [Prof. David Held](https://davheld.github.io/). I work on 3D geometric reasoning for robotic manipulation. My research is supported in part by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).
