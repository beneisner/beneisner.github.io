Here's a list of applications I've submitted (for undergrad admissions, graduate admissions, job applications, fellowship applications, etc.), as well as application materials (when permitted). I've been fortunate to have a very successful career so far, but it has been extremely luck-based. So many opportunities I've had were due to random chance (I'm very grateful for them!).

# 2025

## Fellowships
* Activate Fellowship - rejected w/o interview (this is fair, my pitch was too early)

# 2024

## Summer Internships
Note: since the teams/roles I was looking for were all quite specialized, I didn't submit a formal application anywhere (nor were there formal postings anyway). Mostly was through warm/cold outreach and discussing opportunities with potential managers.

# 2018

I (naively) applied to Ph.D. programs in robotics/ML without any real research experience in the field (had some ML experience, but not related to robotics). This was a big reality-check for me, and led me to leaving my job at Google to work in a robotics research lab at Samsung Research.
